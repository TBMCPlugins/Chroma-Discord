# DiscordPlugin
A plugin that controls the Chroma Bot Discord bot.

# Features
## Announce new posts from /r/ChromaGamers
If it's a (distinguished) moderator post, it'll be posted to the \#announcements channel, otherwise it'll be posted and pinned to \#general.

## Announce server restarts
Currently it only says when the server starts up but that's about to change soon...

# Planned and work-in-progress features
See [here](https://github.com/TBMCPlugins/DiscordPlugin/projects/1).
